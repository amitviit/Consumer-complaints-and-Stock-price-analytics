Do consumer complaints have any effect on stock price of Wells Fargo?


Hello,

Here I am trying to determine whether the stock prices are affected by the consumer complaints in the case of Wells Fargo.

I am working on two separate datasets One, which lists the stock prices of Wells Fargo since its establishment and other which contains the monthly complaints that are recieved by the customer relations department at Wells Fargo.

Attached is the R script that performs the tasks of cleaning , mearging, transforming and modeling the data. Namely, I have created regression model that attempts to find out relationship if any.
